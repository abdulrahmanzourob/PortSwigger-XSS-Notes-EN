### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Lab Scenario Description

- The page contains a **form to add comments**.
    
- When a comment is entered, it is displayed directly on the page, indicating the possibility of direct DOM execution.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Source Code Analysis

- Using Burp Suite, the **response** was examined.
    
- The following code was found within a JavaScript script:
    

```js
function escapeHTML(html) {
  return html.replace('<', '&lt;').replace('>', '&gt;');
}
```

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note:

- The `replace()` function only replaces **the first match**.
    
- For example, if we write the following code in the comment:
    

```html
<h1>z3rob</h1>
```

- The result on the page was:
    

üì∏  
![Pasted image](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250430023738.png)

- As shown, only the first `<` was converted to `&lt;`, and the rest remained as active HTML.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Practical Exploitation

- By exploiting this flaw, we sent the following code:
    

```html
<><img src=x onerror=confirm()>
```

#### ‚úÖ Why does this code work?

- `<><img...>`:
    
    - The first `<` is ignored or partially processed.
        
    - `<img>` is executed as an HTML element.
        
- The event `onerror=confirm()` is executed successfully because it was not fully replaced in the `escapeHTML` function.

- ‚úÖ The JavaScript code was executed and `alert()` appeared.
