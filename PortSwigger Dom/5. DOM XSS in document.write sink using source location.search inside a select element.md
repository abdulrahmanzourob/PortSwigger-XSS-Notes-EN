## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Understanding the Lab Scenario

- The site displays the product page as follows:

![Pasted image](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250429010034.png)

- The idea is that the site fetches the product based on the parameter in the URL which is `productId=1`.


---

### üîç Source Code Analysis

- While examining the source code, I found the following code:


```javascript
var stores = ["London", "Paris", "Milan"];
var store = (new URLSearchParams(window.location.search)).get('storeId');

document.write('<select name="storeId">');

if (store) {
  document.write('<option selected>' + store + '</option>');
}

for (var i = 0; i < stores.length; i++) {
  if (stores[i] === store) {
    continue;
  }
  document.write('<option>' + stores[i] + '</option>');
}

document.write('</select>');
```

#### Code Explanation:

- There is an array containing fixed store names: `London`, `Paris`, `Milan`.

- The value of **`storeId`** is extracted from **`location.search`** (i.e., from the page URL).

- A new **`<select>`** element is created using `document.write`.

- If there is a value in `storeId`, it is added inside `<option selected>`.

- The remaining stores are added as other options inside the same `<select>`.


---

### Testing:

- I tried putting a random word as the value for `storeId` like:


```
product?productId=1&storeId=z3rob
```

- Result:

    ![Pasted image](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250429010617.png)

- As shown in the image: The word `z3rob` appeared in the dropdown list and was injected directly without any validation.


---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Attack Idea (Exploit Idea)

- I sent this URL:


```
product?productId=1&storeId="></select><img src=1 onerror=alert(1)>
```

### What exactly happens here?

#### Step 1: Breaking the Basic Structure

- Starting the `storeId` value with `">` **closes** the open `<option>` tag.


#### Step 2: Breaking the `<select>` Element

- Then `</select>` is sent to close the entire dropdown `<select>` element.


#### Step 3: Injecting a New Element

- After that, a new `<img>` element is created with the `onerror` property containing `alert(1)`.

- Since the image doesn't exist (src=1), the code inside `onerror` is executed.
    
    ![Pasted image](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250429011623.png)
    

### Result:

- As soon as the URL is visited, **JavaScript** code is executed (showing `alert(1)`) which confirms the successful existence of a **DOM XSS** vulnerability.

# ‚úÖ Additional Notes:

- The vulnerability exists because the code directly merges user input into HTML via `document.write` without any validation or encoding (Sanitization / Escaping).

- Using `document.write` is very dangerous and is considered one of the **Bad Practices** in modern programming.

- Instead of `document.write`, more secure techniques should be used like `textContent` or creating DOM elements in a structured way via `createElement`.
