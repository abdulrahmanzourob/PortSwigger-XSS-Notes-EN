## 1. Lab Overview

- The site contains a page with blog articles.
- The site uses **`location.hash`** to determine which article to automatically **scroll** to.
- The code responsible for this:

```js
$(window).on('hashchange', function () {
  var post = $('section.blog-list h2:contains(' + decodeURIComponent(window.location.hash.slice(1)) + ')');
  if (post.length) {
    post.get(0).scrollIntoView();
  }
});
```

This code is written in JavaScript using the jQuery library, and its purpose is to facilitate navigation between blog articles by changing the hash in the URL. Here is a detailed explanation:

### 1. **Event Listener:**
```javascript
$(window).on('hashchange', function () { ... });
```
- **Function:** Listens for changes in the **hash** part of the page URL (the part after `#`, e.g., `#article-1`).
- **Example:** When clicking a link with a new hash, or using the browser's forward/back buttons.

---

### 2. **Decoding the Hash:**
```javascript
decodeURIComponent(window.location.hash.slice(1))
```
- **`window.location.hash`:** Gets the current hash (e.g., `#article-1`).
- **`.slice(1)`:** Removes the `#` to leave just the text (`article-1`).
- **`decodeURIComponent()`:** Decodes any URL-encoded characters (e.g., `%20` to space).

---

### 3. **Finding the Relevant Article:**
```javascript
$('section.blog-list h2:contains(' + ... + ')')
```
- **Goal:** Searches for an `<h2>` element inside the blog section (`section.blog-list`) that contains **text matching the hash**.
- **`:contains()`:** A jQuery selector to find elements containing specific text.

---

### 4. **Scrolling to the Article:**
```javascript
if (post.length) {
  post.get(0).scrollIntoView();
}
```
- **Explanation:** If the element is found (`post.length > 0`):
  - **`post.get(0)`:** Converts the jQuery object to a regular DOM element.
  - **`scrollIntoView()`:** Scrolls the page so the element is visible to the user.

---

### **Practical Example:**
- **URL:** `https://example.com/blog#How-to-code-a-website`
- **On load:** The code searches for an `<h2>` with the text "How-to-code-a-website" and scrolls to it.

**The risk here:**  
You control **location.hash**, which is inserted **directly** into **`$('selector')`** without any filtering or proper handling, leading to **DOM-Based XSS**.

---

## 2. So, what's the exact problem?

When you write in the URL, for example:

```
https://example.com/#something
```

The site will try to find an `<h2>` with the word "something".

But if you put something in the hash that contains smart HTML or JavaScript code, it might get interpreted inside the site, leading to code execution.

But be careful: not any code will work!

Why?

- The code is inside `$('section.blog-list h2:contains(...)')`
- So it's searching for **text inside a heading**, not injecting raw HTML.

**So direct injection is not easy.**

---

## 3. Why can't you just put the payload directly in the link?

If you do this:

```
https://YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/#<img src=x onerror=print()>
```

The site does not insert the hash as **HTML** into the page.  
It uses it **inside a jQuery selector**.

So it translates to something like:

```javascript
$('section.blog-list h2:contains(<img src=x onerror=print()>)')
```

This does **not** make `<img>` execute!  
JavaScript will search for an h2 heading with the literal text `<img src=x onerror=print()>`, not insert an `<img>` element into the page.

Therefore:  
**You need to find a way to make the code "interpreted" inside the page or the selector in a smart way.**

---

## 4. Why did we use an `iframe` code instead of a direct link?

The solution here relies on:

- Open the page normally (just `#`, i.e., empty hash).
- As soon as the page loads, modify the `src` of the `iframe` and add the malicious code to it.

The code you will use:

```html
<iframe src="https://YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/#" onload="this.src+='<img src=x onerror=print()>'"></iframe>
```

### Details:

- The iframe opens the site with an empty hash:  
    No risk at this point, the page just loads.
    
- After the iframe loads (`onload`), this code executes:
    
    ```javascript
    this.src += '<img src=x onerror=print()>';
    ```
    
    What does it do?
    
    - Takes the current page URL (`src`) and appends the malicious code (`<img src=x onerror=print()>`).
    - This changes the hash via JavaScript!
- Since the page listens for any **hashchange** (`$(window).on('hashchange', function() {...})`),  
    As soon as the hash changes, the site's code executes automatically.

# Why does normal text work with a regular link (scrolls to the post), but the payload only works via the iframe path?

## 1. jQuery selector language and valid CSS

- **Normal text** (e.g., "MyPost") is a **valid CSS selector** inside
    
    ```js
    $('section.blog-list h2:contains(MyPost)')
    ```
    
    ✔️ Sizzle (jQuery's selector engine) accepts it without issues and returns the `<h2>` element present in the page.
    
- **Payload** with `<img …>` is an **invalid selector** — it contains HTML tags inside the `:contains()` → Sizzle throws an error.
    

---

## 2. Two paths for error handling in jQuery Migrate

1. **Normal text**: No error → normal path → finds the post and calls `scrollIntoView()`.
    
2. **Payload**: Error → Migrate "catches" the error and says: "Let me try to treat the string as HTML" → creates an `<img>` element → onerror executes `print()`.
    

---

## 3. Why does the normal link work for normal text?

- The links under each post (View post) are `<a href="#post-title">` within the page itself.
    
- **Clicking this link** changes the hash **dynamically** without reloading → triggers `hashchange` → the code runs on the normal path (valid selector) → scrolls to the element.
    

---

## 4. Why does the payload need an iframe?

- If you **open the page with an external link containing the payload** (`https://…/#payload`) ← this is an initial load with the hash ← the event is not yet bound ← `hashchange` **does not fire** ← neither selector nor fallback path runs.
    
- But if you use an **iframe**:
    
    - The page loads first without a hash
        
    - Then the hash is **dynamically** changed inside the context (the page or the iframe)
        
    - `hashchange` fires → the code runs → passes through the fallback and triggers `print()`.
    

--- 
# Very Important
### Practical Summary

- **Normal text + internal link** → dynamic event → valid selector → scroll.
    
- **Payload + initial load** → no event → no execution.
    
- **Payload + dynamic change** (iframe/console/anchor inside the page) → event → selector throws error → Migrate converts to HTML → onerror executes payload.
---

## 6. Final Steps:

- Open the **Exploit Server**.
- Put this code in the **Body**:

```html
<iframe src="https://YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/#" onload="this.src+='<img src=x onerror=print()>'"></iframe>
```

- Save the exploit.
- Click **View exploit** --> if you see `print()` executed --> you're good.
- Then click **Deliver to victim** --> if the victim sees it and it works --> you've solved the lab.

# Additional Explanation

When you put a normal word after the `#` and the same word exists in the `<h2>` headings on the page, three simple things happen:

1. **You trigger "hashchange"**
    
    - Suppose you open the page without a hash (`https://site.com/`), then change the hash manually in the URL →
        
        ```js
        window.location.hash = "MyPost";
        ```
        
    - This is a dynamic change in the fragment, so the `hashchange` event we bound in jQuery actually fires.
        
2. **jQuery runs the selector as a valid CSS selector**
    
    - The code builds this expression exactly:
        
        ```js
        $('section.blog-list h2:contains(MyPost)')
        ```
        
    - Because "MyPost" is normal text, this is a valid CSS selector, Sizzle (jQuery's selector engine) parses it without issues and finds the `<h2>` element containing that word.
        
3. **Finds the element in the page and calls scrollIntoView**
    
    - Since `post.length > 0`, it calls
        
        ```js
        post.get(0).scrollIntoView()
        ```
        
    - Result: the page scrolls to the required heading.
        

---

## Why doesn't the payload work the same way?

1. **The payload contains `<` and `>` – not normal text**
    
    - Example:
        
        ```
        anything')<img src=x onerror=print()>
        ```
        
    - When you put it inside:
        
        ```js
        $('section.blog-list h2:contains(anything')<img src=x onerror=print()>')
        ```
        
        This is not a valid CSS selector (it contains an HTML tag inside).
        
2. **jQuery tries to parse the selector, finds an error, and throws an exception**
    
    - Here, the jQuery Migrate library steps in and says:
        
        > "Okay, instead of crashing the page, let's try to treat the string as HTML"
        
    - So it calls `jQuery.parseHTML()` on that string and turns it into an actual `<img>` element.
        
3. **The `<img>` works, is injected in memory, and there's no scroll for the reasons below**
    
    - The browser tries to load the image from `src="x"` → fails → triggers `onerror` → executes `print()`.
        
    - Then `post.length` is > 0 (because parseHTML returned nodes), so it calls `scrollIntoView()` on the first node (the `<img>`).
        
    - But since this element is not actually added to the main DOM, you won't see any real scroll.
        

---

### Summary

- **A word present in the page = valid CSS selector → finds the element → scrolls to it**
    
- **Payload with `<img>` = invalid selector → jQuery Migrate fallback to HTML → executes onerror → print()**
