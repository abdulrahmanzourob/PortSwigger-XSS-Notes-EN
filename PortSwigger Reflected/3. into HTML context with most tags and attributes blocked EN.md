## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Understanding the Lab Scenario

The lab starts with a website containing a simple search function. When entering a search term and clicking the "Search" button, the site displays a results page that includes the searched term. This is where user-controlled data (the search term) is injected and reflected back in the HTML response, making it a potential candidate for a Reflected XSS vulnerability.

- **Input Point:** Search box
- **Behavior:** The entered word is displayed on the results page

### Initial XSS Injection Attempt

The first and natural attempt is to inject a simple `<script>` tag to see if it will be executed:

```html
<script>alert(1)</script>
```

However, as shown in the original notes, this tag is blocked or disabled by a sanitization mechanism implemented by the site.

![Pasted image](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250430175711.png)

The result shows that the `<script>` tag was not interpreted as HTML, but was displayed as plain text or modified to prevent execution.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Discovering Allowed Elements (Tags and Attributes)

Since common tags like `<script>` are blocked, the next step is to identify which tags and attributes are allowed by the site. Tools like Burp Suite Intruder can be used to automate this process.

### üîç Discovering Allowed Tags

A list of common HTML tags (obtainable from sources like [PortSwigger XSS Cheat Sheet](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/cheat-sheet)) was used as payloads in Burp Intruder. Each tag was sent as part of a search request and the response was monitored.

The goal is to find tags that are not blocked or significantly modified in the response. Based on the notes, it was discovered that the `<body>` tag is allowed.

![Pasted image](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250430182007.png)

### üîç Discovering Allowed Attributes

After identifying an allowed tag (`<body>`), the next step is to find attributes that can be used with this tag to execute JavaScript. Event-related attributes like `onload`, `onerror`, `onresize` are common targets.

An attempt was made to inject the `<body>` tag with the `onload` attribute:

```html
<body onload=alert(1)>
```

![Pasted image](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250430182331.png)

However, the result showed that the `onload` attribute is also blocked.

![Pasted image](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250430182338.png)

Therefore, Burp Intruder was used again, but this time with a list of common event attributes, to test them with the allowed `<body>` tag.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Developing the Successful Payload

Through the process of testing attributes using Burp Intruder, it was discovered that the `onresize` attribute is allowed with the `<body>` tag. This attribute can be exploited to execute JavaScript when the element's size changes (in this case, the `<body>`).

The following payload was constructed:

```html
<body onresize="print()">
```

- **`<body>`**: The allowed tag
- **`onresize`**: The allowed event attribute, which is triggered when the element's size changes
- **`print()`**: A JavaScript function. In the context of the lab, calling `print()` is sufficient to prove the vulnerability and achieve the lab's goal (PortSwigger labs typically require calling a specific function like `alert()`, `print()`, or `confirm()`)

When injecting this payload into the search box, it was accepted and not blocked.

![Pasted image](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250430182914.png)

**Note:** For the `onresize` event to actually trigger, the size of the injected `<body>` element must change. This might not happen automatically on the main page.

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Final Solution Explanation (Using `iframe`)

To ensure the `onresize` event triggers and achieve the lab's goal (calling `print()`), an `iframe` was used to embed the target page with the malicious payload in the search parameter, along with code to change the `iframe`'s size after loading.

The final payload used to send to the victim (or in this case, to prove exploitation to the server) is:

```html
<iframe width="50px" onload="this.style.width='100px'" src="https://0ab1009f03661529a45e6b7600f8001e.web-security-academy.net/?search=<body onresize='print(0)'>"></iframe>
```

**Explanation of payload components:**

1. **`<iframe ...>`**: Creates an `iframe` element
2. **`width="50px"`**: Sets an initial small width for the `iframe`
3. **`onload="this.style.width='100px'"`**: This is the key part to trigger `onresize`
    * `onload`: This code executes after the `iframe` content is fully loaded
    * `this.style.width='100px'`: This code changes the `iframe`'s own width from `50px` to `100px`
4. **`src="..."`**: Specifies the URL to be loaded inside the `iframe`. It's the lab's own link, but with the malicious payload (`<body onresize='print(0)'>`) added as the value for the `search` parameter
    * **`https://0ab1009f03661529a45e6b7600f8001e.web-security-academy.net/?search=`**: The target page's link
    * **`<body onresize='print(0)'>`**: The payload we discovered earlier, which will be injected into the results page inside the `iframe`

**How it works:**

1. The browser loads the `iframe`
2. The `src` content is loaded inside the `iframe`. This content is the search results page containing the injected `<body onresize='print(0)'>`
3. Once the `iframe` is fully loaded, its `onload` event triggers
4. The code in `onload` (`this.style.width='100px'`) changes the `iframe`'s width
5. Changing the `iframe`'s size causes its content (the loaded results page) to resize
6. Resizing the `iframe`'s content in turn triggers the `onresize` event of the injected `<body>` element inside the `iframe`
7. When `onresize` triggers, its associated code, `print(0)`, executes
8. The `print()` function is called, successfully solving the lab

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Summary

This lab demonstrates how to handle Reflected XSS scenarios where most common tags and attributes are blocked. The process involves:

1. **Understanding:** Identifying the input point and how data is reflected
2. **Discovery:** Using tools like Burp Intruder to systematically identify allowed tags and attributes
3. **Exploitation:** Building a payload using allowed elements (like `<body>` and `onresize`)
4. **Execution:** Using additional techniques (like `iframe` and resizing) to ensure the desired event (`onresize`) triggers and the malicious code (`print()`) executes
