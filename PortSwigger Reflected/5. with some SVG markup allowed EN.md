## üî∞ Lab Description

This lab contains a reflected XSS vulnerability. The site blocks well-known tags like `<script>`, but allows some SVG tags and some of their events.

The goal is to execute XSS that shows an `alert()`.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Understanding the Lab Scenario

The first thing I tried was to write `<script>` in the search box, and this was the result:

Then it showed me that `<script>` is not allowed:

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Discovering Allowed Elements (Tags and Attributes)

Since well-known tags like `<script>` are blocked, I started to check which tags and attributes are allowed by the site.  
I used Burp Suite Intruder to automate testing with a list of tags.

### üîç Discovering Unblocked Tags

I got a list of HTML tags from the XSS Cheat Sheet, and tried sending them one by one in the search box and watched the server's response.

I tried this payload:

```html
<svg><animatetransform onload=alert(0)></svg
```

I got this message:

![Pasted image](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250504012756.png)

Then I decided to do the same step but change the events I used and see what would work:

![Pasted image](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250504012831.png)

And when I tried this payload, it worked:

```html
<svg><animatetransform onbegin=alert(0)></svg
```

And I got the alert:
