## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Understanding the Lab Scenario

- The website contains a **search** field.
    
- When typing any word and clicking **Search**, the **word is displayed** in the results page.

### üîç Source Code Analysis

While examining the code, I noticed that the search word is reflected in two different locations within the page:

#### First Location:

![Pasted image](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250428024924.png)

- Here, all special characters like `<`, `>`, `"`, `'` are **filtered**, preventing exploitation of this location for malicious code injection.
    

#### Second Location:

![Pasted image](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250428024954.png)

- Here, only **angle brackets** (`<`, `>`) are encoded to HTML entities (`&lt;` and `&gt;`),
    
- **But** leaves quotes (`'` and `"`) without encoding or filtering.
    

> ‚ö°Ô∏è This security gap allows us to **break the string** and inject JavaScript commands.

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Attack Concept (Exploit Idea)

Since quotes weren't encoded, we can exploit this by:

1. **Breaking the string** using `'` or `"`.
    
2. **Injecting JavaScript code** (e.g., `alert()`).
    
3. **Commenting out the rest of the line** to prevent errors (using `//`).
    

### Expected Final Code After Injection:

```html
<script>
  var searchTerms = '';alert(0);//';
</script>
```

### üî∑ Payload Used:

```javascript
';alert(0);//
```

### üîπ Payload Explanation:

|Part|Function|
|---|---|
|`';`|Terminates the original string inside the variable.|
|`alert(0);`|Executes a JavaScript command to display an alert window (proof of successful injection).|
|`//`|Comments out the remaining original code to prevent any breaks or errors during execution.|

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Final Result

- The code was successfully injected.
    
- An alert window appeared, confirming successful exploitation of the vulnerability.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Additional Notes ‚úçÔ∏è

- This vulnerability is considered **Reflected XSS**, meaning inputs are processed directly in the response to the same request.
    
- It's commonly exploited in **Social Engineering** to deceive the victim.
    

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ How to Protect the Website from This Vulnerability? üîí

To protect applications from XSS:

- **Properly encode (Encode) all inputs** according to context:
    
    - If the value is inside JavaScript ‚Üí must encode `'`, `"`, `\`, and others.
        
- **Avoid directly inserting data into code** without processing.
    
- **Use Content Security Policy (CSP)** to reduce XSS impact if it occurs.
    
- **Utilize ready-made libraries** for input processing like DOMPurify.
    

---

## Summary üìù

- Understanding the context where inputs are used (HTML / JavaScript / Attribute / URL) is the **most important point** in discovering the vulnerability.
    
- Merely encoding `<` and `>` is not enough to prevent XSS within JavaScript String Context.
    
- Always test how well fields are protected against `'`, `"`, and `\` characters.
