### 1️⃣ General Information

|Element|Details|
|---|---|
|**Lab Link**|[Reflected XSS in canonical link tag](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/contexts/lab-canonical-link-tag)|
|**Solution Date**|8 / 5 / 2025|
|**Vulnerability Type**|Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)|

---

### 2️⃣ Understanding the Lab Scenario

The site displays user input inside:

```html
<link rel="canonical" href="USER_INPUT">
```

It escapes the angle brackets `<` and `>`, and double quotes (`"`), but **does not secure single quotes (`'`)**. This is what we will exploit for injection.

---

### ✅ What is the Canonical Tag?

It is a tag placed inside the `<head>` of a web page, for example:

```html
<link rel="canonical" href="https://example.com/page.html">
```

#### Its meaning:

It tells Google and search engines that **this link is the main (original) version** of the page.

---

### 💡 Why do we use it?

If there are many versions of the same page (like pages with parameters in the URL), search engines won't get confused and think they're different pages.

✅ Example:

|URL|Meaning|
|---|---|
|`https://example.com/product?id=123`|Version with a parameter|
|`https://example.com/product`|The original version|

We use canonical like this:

```html
<link rel="canonical" href="https://example.com/product">
```

---

### 😈 How do we exploit this in the lab?

The site takes your input and puts it inside:

```html
<link rel="canonical" href="YOUR_INPUT">
```

Without proper sanitization, so we can:

1. Close the value of the `href`
2. Add a new attribute with JavaScript code
3. Complete the tag so it looks valid

---

### 💻 Initial Test:

We tried to input:

```
testt " > '
```

The result:

- The browser filtered double quotes (`"`) and angle brackets (`< >`)
- But **left the single quote (`'`)**

This means we can exploit the vulnerability by injecting using single quotes.

---

### ✅ Payload Used:

```html
?/'accesskey='x'onclick='alert(0)
```

---

### 📚 Payload Explanation:

#### 🔹 `?/'`
- The start of the payload, trying to break the tag containing `href`
- The goal is to **close the value** of `href` so we can add things after it

#### 🔹 `accesskey='x'`
- A normal HTML attribute that binds a key to the link
- Here, we use it just to pass the code

#### 🔹 `onclick='alert(0)'`
- This is the JavaScript that executes when the user clicks the element
- So when clicked ➜ `alert(0)` is executed

---

### 💣 The Goal of the Payload:

Inject JavaScript into the `<link rel="canonical">` or `<a>` tag so it executes when the user interacts with the page.

---

### 💡 Practical Example:

If there is code like this in the page:

```html
<a href="/page?user=USER_INPUT">Click here</a>
```

And you input the payload:

```
?/'accesskey='x'onclick='alert(0)
```

It becomes:

```html
<a href="/page?/'accesskey='x'onclick='alert(0)">Click here</a>
```

And when clicked ➜ `alert(0)` happens

### 🧠 What do I gain from this? Why is it important?

#### ✅ What I learned:
- I understood how the canonical tag can have an XSS vulnerability
- I learned how to check the types of encoding or escaping the site does
- I gained experience in exploiting attributes instead of just relying on `<script>`

#### 🧠 Why is it important?
- This type of XSS is sneaky and not obvious, which makes it more dangerous
- Understanding these scenarios helps you write secure web code, or discover real vulnerabilities in other sites
