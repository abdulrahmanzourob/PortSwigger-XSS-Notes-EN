## First: Understanding the Lab Scenario

- The website has a **search** field.

- When you type any word and click **Search**, the word is reflected in the results page.

    ![Pasted image](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250428001854.png)

- But importantly: The website performs **HTML encoding** on **angle brackets** `< >` (meaning it converts them to `&lt;` and `&gt;`) to prevent you from writing HTML tags directly.

![Pasted image](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250428002048.png)
    
- Well... since `<` and `>` are secured (impossible to open a new tag), can we still perform XSS?
    
- **Yes**! The reason is that our input is injected into an **Attribute** (specifically into the `value` of `<input>`), not into plain text.
    

---

## Second: Code Reflection Location

Look at the code you got:

```html
<input type=text placeholder='Search the blog...' name=search value=""onmouseover="alert(1)">
```

- Your input (`"onmouseover="alert(1)`) was injected into the **value** attribute of the element.
    
- The final result was an **Attribute Injection**.
    
- Instead of being `value="normal text"`, it became:
    
    - `value="" onmouseover="alert(1)"`
        

So we actually created a **new attribute** called `onmouseover`! And this is an **Event Handler** that executes code when the mouse hovers over the element.

---

## Third: Detailed Payload Explanation

### Why did we use `"onmouseover="alert(1)`?

- The first `"` (quote) **closes** the `value="..."` that we were inside.
    
- Then we wrote `onmouseover="alert(1)"` as if it were a **new attribute** in the element.
    
- So it happened that:
    
    1. We closed the original value.
        
    2. We added a new event (onmouseover).
        
    3. We wrote the code we wanted (`alert(1)`).
        

---

## Fourth: Detailed Solution Steps

1. I typed any word in the search (e.g., `test`) and clicked Search.
    ![Pasted image](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250428001854.png)
2. I saw that the word was reflected in the HTML code in the **value** location.
    ![Pasted image](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250428002048.png)

3. I replaced the word I typed with the Payload:
```js
 "onmouseover="alert(1)
```

![Pasted image](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250428002642.png)

So when clicking on the `inputbox` it triggers the alert

---

## Fifth: Other Examples of the Same Concept

You don't always have to use `onmouseover`, you can use any other event. Examples:

|Event|When it triggers|Example payload|
|---|---|---|
|`onfocus`|When the element gets focus (e.g., when clicked)|`"onfocus="alert(1)`|
|`onclick`|When clicked|`"onclick="alert(1)`|
|`oninput`|When typing inside the element|`"oninput="alert(1)`|
|`onmouseenter`|When mouse enters the element|`"onmouseenter="alert(1)`|

All of these rely on the same concept:  
**Close the quote " and add a new Event**.

## Sixth: Why Focus on Attribute Types?

- Not all elements accept all events.

- For example: The `<input>` element can accept `onfocus`, `onmouseover`, `oninput`, but not `onload`.

- The `<img>` element accepts `onerror`.

- `<body>` accepts `onload`.


That's why you need to understand the element type to choose the appropriate Event.

## Seventh: Quick Summary

- **Website Problem**: It wasn't securing **input within Attributes**.
    
- **Solution**: We closed the Attribute we were in and injected a new Attribute.
    
- **Steps**:
    
    1. Send random input.
        
    2. See reflection location.
        
    3. Inject payload with `"` to close the quote and an Event Handler like `onmouseover`.
        
    4. Test the code.
