## 🧪 Lab Report: Reflected XSS in JavaScript String

|Element|Details|
|---|---|
|**Lab Link**|[Reflected XSS into a JavaScript string with angle brackets and double quotes HTML-encoded and single quotes escaped](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/contexts/lab-javascript-string-angle-brackets-double-quotes-encoded-single-quotes-escaped)|
|**Solution Date**|10 / 5 / 2025|
|**Vulnerability Type**|Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)|

## 🎯 Understanding the Lab Scenario

- The site has a **search bar**.
    
- As soon as you type any word and press **Search**, the word appears on the results page.
    
- The code that displays the word on the page puts it inside a **JavaScript String**.

## 🔍 Source Code Analysis

### Filtering Analysis:

- The code encodes:
    
    - `<` and `>` → become `&lt;` and `&gt;`
    - `"` → becomes `&quot;`
    
- As for **`'` (single quote)**, it is escaped with a backslash, so it becomes `\'`
    

### The Problem:

When the server escapes the `'` like this:

```js
var searchTerm = 'YOUR_INPUT';
```

It becomes:

```js
var searchTerm = 'user\'input';
```

If we enter input containing a backslash, we can break this filtering!

## 💥 Executing the Payload

### The idea:

- Write `\` to escape the previous backslash.
    
- Then `'` to close the string.
    
- Write the code we want (for example, `alert(0)`).
    
- Finally, add `//` to comment out the rest of the code.
    

### Payload used:

```js
\';alert(0);//
```

✅ The `alert` worked, which means the XSS was successful.

## 🧠 Additional Notes

- This vulnerability is **Reflected XSS** because the code returns the input directly without storing it.
    
- The reason for the vulnerability's success is that the **context** of the input is inside a JavaScript String, so we focus on the type of quote filtering.
    
- The filtering here fails to handle the backslash, which is what allowed us to break the line.
