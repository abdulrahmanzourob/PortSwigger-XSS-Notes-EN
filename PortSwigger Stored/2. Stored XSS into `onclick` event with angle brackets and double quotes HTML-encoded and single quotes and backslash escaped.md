## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Understanding the Lab Scenario

- **Lab Objective:** Exploit an XSS vulnerability within an `<a>` element containing an `onclick` event handler where user input is injected.
    
- **Input Processing Applied:**
    
    1. **HTML Encoding:**
        
        - `<` ‚Üí `&lt;`
            
        - `>` ‚Üí `&gt;`
            
        - `"` ‚Üí `&quot;`
            
    2. **Character Escaping:**
        
        - `'` ‚Üí `\'`
            
        - `\` ‚Üí `\\`

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Source Code Analysis

Example of HTML code after entering the name: `z3rob > ' "`:

```html
<a
  id="author"
  href="https://z3rb ' &quot; &gt;"
  onclick="var tracker = { track() {} }; tracker.track('https://z3rb \' &quot; &gt;');">
  z3rb &apos; &quot; &gt;
</a>
```

### Notes:

1. `<`, `>`, `"` were encoded.
    
2. `'` and `\` were escaped.
    
3. Injection is inside the `onclick` attribute, so we need to break the string inside `tracker.track('...')`.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Exploitation Steps

### 1. First Attempt:

Payload: `https://test.com?';alert(0);//`  
Result:

```js
tracker.track('https://test.com?\';alert(0);//');
```

‚ùå Failed due to server-side escaping (`\'` instead of `'`).

---

### 2. Attempting to Counteract Escaping by Adding Extra `\`:

Also failed due to backslash repetition.

---

### 3. Attempting to Use HTML Entity Alternative for `'`:

Payload: `https://test?&#x27;alert(1)//;`  
‚ùå Failed ‚Äî the entity still undergoes escaping.

---

### 4. **Successful Attempt:**

Payload:

```text
https://test?&#x27;-alert(1)-&#x27;
```

Final Analysis After Code Insertion:

```js
tracker.track('https://test?&#x27;-alert(1)-&#x27;');
```

After HTML Entity Interpretation:

```js
tracker.track('https://test?'-alert(1)-'');
```

### How It Works:

1. `&#x27;` = `'` ‚Üí Closes the original string.
    
2. `-alert(1)-` ‚Üí Executed as standalone JavaScript code.
    
3. The `//` comment after the injection code prevents execution of any code after it (if included).
    
4. The actual resulting code:
    
    ```js
    tracker.track('https://test?'; 
    alert(1);
    //'');
    ```

Let me compile all the detailed notes about this section:

## üîë **Detailed Notes on Escaping and Injection**

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **How the Server Processes Data**

- The server takes user input and places it in **JavaScript** within a specific context.
    
    Example:
    
    ```js
    tracker.track('[[USER INPUT HERE]]');
    ```
    
    Any value inside **`' '`** (single quotes) is processed by the server through **escaping** special characters like:
    
    - **`'`** (or **`&#x27;`**) is replaced with `\'`.
        
    - **`"`** (or **`&quot;`**) is replaced with `\"`.
        
    - **`\`** is replaced with `\\`.
        
    
    This is to protect the code and prevent **unexpected string termination**.
    

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **When Escaping Doesn't Occur**

- **When exiting the string context**.
    
    When **`'`** or **`&#x27;`** exit the string context (e.g., after the original string is closed), the server **does not process** or **escape** the characters.
    
    In this case, an attacker can place **JavaScript code** directly outside the string context.
    

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Example of Failed Escaping:**

If the user enters:

```text
ahmed&#x27;alert(1)
```

- The server will take this value and try to insert it into the code as:
    
    ```js
    tracker.track('ahmed\'alert(1)');
    ```
    
- Note that:
    
    - The server escaped the `'` to `\'`.
        
    - The code **doesn't execute** because it's **inside the string**.
        

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Example of Successful Escaping:**

But if the user enters:

```text
ahmed&#x27;-alert(1)-&#x27;
```

Which becomes:

```js
tracker.track('ahmed'-alert(1)-'');
```

- Here we **closed the string** at the first `'`,
    
- Then added **JavaScript code outside the string** (`alert(1)`),
    
- Therefore the code executes outside the string context.
    

### üí° The Reason:

- The server didn't escape `&#x27;` because this value **was already inside a closed string**, so the server isn't required to escape after the string is closed.
    
- After the open string, the **code is outside the string**, so the browser processes it as **JavaScript code**.
    

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **When Special Characters Are Escaped**

- **When they exist inside the string context**, meaning if **`'` or `"` or `\`** exist inside a JavaScript string, the server adds a **backslash (`\`)** before them, to avoid unexpected string termination or execution of unwanted code.
    
    Example:
    
    - If the user enters `ahmed&#x27;alert(1)`:
        
        - The server will add a backslash to become `ahmed\'alert(1)`, thus the code doesn't execute.
            
- But in case of **exiting** the special character from the string, like the case of `-alert(1)-` in the successful payload, no backslash is added, thus the JavaScript code executes correctly.
    

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Effect of `-` in the Successful Payload:**

- **`-`** in the payload works as a **safe separator** between different parts of the payload.
    
- Instead of **`;;`** or spaces, **`-`** was used because it's not a special character that might interfere with parsing or processing by the server or browser.
    
    **Note:** `-` is just a separator for writing the code, so **it doesn't process JavaScript code inside the string**.
    

---

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ **The `&#x27;` at the End of the Payload:**

- The `&#x27;` in the successful payload `ahmed&#x27;-alert(1)-&#x27;` acts as a **string terminator** after the original string has ended.
    
- After decoding the HTML entity, it becomes `'` and closes the original string, allowing the following code (like `alert(1)`) to work outside the string.
