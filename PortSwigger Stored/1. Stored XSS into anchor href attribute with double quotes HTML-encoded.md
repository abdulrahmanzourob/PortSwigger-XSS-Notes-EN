## 1. General Lab Concept

- The idea is that the website has a place where I can post a comment

![Pasted image](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250428005732.png)

- I tried values like those in the image and when I looked at the source code

- As you can see, all tags were decoded, but is that it?
- No, we still have the link where we can inject our payload

# Attack Concept

- We can execute JavaScript code through the link using `javascript:alert(0)`  
```html
<a id="author" href="[javascript:alert(0)](about:blank)">z3rob</a>
```

As you can see, anyone who clicks the link will execute the code
