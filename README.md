# PortSwigger Web Security Labs Solutions

## üìö Overview

This repository contains detailed documentation and solutions for various web security labs from PortSwigger Web Security Academy. The focus is primarily on Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, including Reflected, Stored, DOM-based, and Blind XSS scenarios.

## üéØ Purpose

The main objectives of this repository are:
- Document and explain different types of XSS vulnerabilities
- Provide detailed walkthroughs of PortSwigger lab solutions
- Serve as a learning resource for web security professionals
- Demonstrate various exploitation techniques and prevention methods
